		<h3>post-ecocide</h3>
		
		<p>Columns of lime green and neon pink glow between sleek corporate shrines. Light curves around these structures&mdash;gorgeously designed, immaculately maintained&mdash;temples to the beverage-sippers and hand-shakers: creatures of Value.</p>

<p>These things&mdash;not so much flesh and blood as they are twisted effigies to enterprise&mdash;facilitate, oversee, macro-manage the machinations of contemporary society. Traditional bodily fluids have long been out of vogue in these circles, often replaced by whatever hot new synthetic hormones are currently trending.</p>

<p>A nearby array of vending machines flashes a dazzling, rippling kaleidoscope, showcasing a mixture of luxury branded Peptides and Mechano-Growth Factors; sealed, bottled in flashy and easy-to-ingest packages.</p>

<p>These hot and sexy chemicals course through the various appendages, upgrades, downgrades, enhancements, extenders, elongators, stretchers, morphers, and other enhancements which embellish the creatures, transforming them into beautiful symphonies of Metal and Plastic. Here, augmentation is not simply for practicality&rsquo;s sake; it is high art&mdash;a reflection of the individual&rsquo;s tastes and sensibilities.</p>

<p>Bursts of blinding and brand-recognizable colours stream along every surface, etching their shapes into the retinas of the unequipped. Those of particularly low valuation, unable to afford light-protection, have these shapes burned into their flesh. In the boardrooms above, a creature chuckles:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bearing our logos, they have acquired more value.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are not long for this world anyway&rdquo;, another replies,</p>

<p>&ldquo;So hyped up on inhalants and drinkables&mdash;they do not feel, nor hear nor smell, the char of the atmosphere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was true. As the years continue to stretch post-ecocide, the char has only continued to increase in its ferocity. It was hard to imagine a time without it.</p>

<p>The scraping of steel on steel fills steel chambers as one of the executives stands.</p>

<p>With six limbs, it locomotes smoothly in spite of its jagged appearance, a dark mass suspended by thin crab legs. The head extends from it, perched upon a skeletal steel spine, peering down.</p>

<p>it joins its peers along the boardroom window. Brows furrow.</p>

<p>&quot;Not enough.&quot;</p>

<p>High above the clouds, the only things visible against the crimson red sky are scrapers of similar prominence, and the neon beams of ads which descend intermittently from the exosphere.</p>

<p>&quot;We must press forward. Opportunities dwindling. Lean forward. Position aggressively.&quot;</p>

<p>An executive churns, acrid liquid bubbling from its oesophagus.</p>

<p>&quot;Shareholders won't like it. Pushed too deep already. Almost in the red.&quot;</p>

<p>Another hisses.</p>

<p>&quot;Unheard of. Unheard of.&quot;</p>

<p>Some join in, like a nest of snakes disturbed.</p>

<p>&quot;Enough.&quot; Black eyes dart left, then right.</p>

<p>&quot;We hold a vote. Control the quorum. Not enough of them. More of us.&quot;</p>

<p>Hushed whispers between the executives.</p>

<p>&quot;Findings show. Risk for reward. Promote growth.&quot;</p>

<p>Its cold talon taps the chrome table, reverberating.</p>

<p>&quot;Cannot stagnate. The only way. Progress or death. Press forward. Press forward.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Press forward. Press forward.&quot;</p>

<p>The mantra is repeated until all are chanting it, building into a cruel, metallic chorus that fills the boardroom chamber, down the steel halls, and across the penthouse floor.</p>
